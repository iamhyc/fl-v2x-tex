\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, an uplink scheduling framework, namely {\fwName}, is proposed to optimize the model uploading for federated learning in vehicular networks.
The proposed {\fwName} framework is composed of two components: the high-fidelity trajectory simulator and the scheduling optimizer.
With the assistance of the trajectory simulator, the stationary transition probability of the trajectories is verified, and hence, the trajectory of each {\IAV} is modeled as a time-invariant Markov chain.
The uplink transmission scheduling problem is modeled as a finite-horizon MDP.
The optimal solution suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Instead, the scheduling optimizer addresses the transmission time allocation via periodic global deterministic optimization, and power allocation via local finite-horizon MDP. Non-trivial performance bounds are derived for the above low-complexity suboptimal solution.
The simulation results show that the proposed solution framework can achieve both significant performance gain  compared to baselines and a flexible performance-complexity tradeoff.
